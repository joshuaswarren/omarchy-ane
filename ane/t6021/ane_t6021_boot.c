 * ane_t6021_boot.c — T6021 boot state reporter (W15).
 *
 * READ-ONLY. Main review 2026-09-20: the unresolved pre-CPU power and
 * config-table prerequisites BLOCK every boot write, so this unit
 * performs no MMIO write at all — it resolves the boot-input state,
 * reports it with per-read whitelist provenance, and names the exact
 * missing lifecycle datum. The write path (RVBAR entry fold + CPU RUN
 * release + first-alive ack) lands only after the prerequisites below
 * are pinned; its pure contract units (entry fold, latch/entry decode,
 * SCRATCH u64 split, init-structure fill) live in ane_t6021_boot.h and
 * are regression-tested host-side (tools/h14_boot_regression.c).
 *
 * Blocked boot writes, with the blocking prerequisite each one waits on:
 *   - RVBAR entry fold (ENTRY_BASE | fw DVA & ADDR_MASK; single u64
 *     store, width_proof 0x95e9860→0x9622b0c read / 0x95e9988→0x9622c94
 *     write): semantics of the observed RVBAR read 0x1 are unresolved
 *     (see the rvbar lifecycle fork) AND the pre-CPU block
 *     below applies regardless.
 *   - CPU_CONTROL write32 0 then 0x10 (rvbar-width local order): waits
 *     on the same pre-CPU block; releasing RUN with an unresolved
 *     entry state is the exact blind start the lane forbids.
 *   - SCRATCH0/1 publication + SCRATCH7 wake: init-structure fields
 *     [0x08] and [0x10,0x38) have no pinned selene fn 0x71A4 consumer
 *     read-set; zero-filling unknown fields and calling the structure
 *     valid is forbidden (Main 2026-09-20).
 *
 * Pre-CPU prerequisites, updated for pass4 (receipts 2026-09-20
 * mapper-callchain pass4 + tools/check_power_anchors.py 33/33, commit
 * 04630ef):
 *   RESOLVED (pass4): the CPU-power branch selector — H14g SoCConfig
 *     zeroes dev+0x3EA0 (0x9613e14, the block that also sets
 *     dev+0x4A0=0x01400044), so EnableCPUClocksAndPower takes the
 *     PLAIN branch: write32(PMGR+0x2e0, 0x0000000f), validate 0xff —
 *     AUTO_ENABLE bit28 never set. On Linux this END STATE is exactly
 *     what the first_resume stage-2/3 gate verifies (act=0xf,
 *     AUTO_ENABLE clear) before any of this code runs — the write is
 *     therefore not replicated (ps-word writes are forbidden by the
 *     standing rule and froze the box 2026-09-19); the gate IS the
 *     equivalence check.
 *   STILL OPEN (each blocks its write below):
 *   1. CLOSED (pass5 c364f24): the pre-CPU engine table writels
 *      eng+0xb38/0xb98/0xbf8 <- 0x01ff01ff are REQUIRED every
 *      EnableANEClocksAndPower — dev+0x784 bit0 has no writer, so the
 *      always-open gate runs the loop unconditionally; the
 *      order-vs-start question is moot. Receiver PROVEN pass4
 *      (dev+0x188 accessor = engine reg[0]); count = config+0x150 =
 *      3. Armed below; the first live firing must ride netconsole
 *      behind the seam logs.
 *   2. Provider first-enable enableDeviceClock(1,dev+0x8F0)/
 *      enableDevicePower(1,&out,dev+0x8F0) (0x95d1d48/0x95d1d90):
 *      internal gate-ID arrays are runtime-populated (open). Linux
 *      substitutes the genpd raise + supplier links (islands verified
 *      ACTUAL=0xf by the gate); the equivalence datum is the open
 *      half.
 *   3. RVBAR lifecycle — RESOLVED (M2ResetLifecycle,
 *     rvbar-lifecycle-evidence.json, anchors 38/38
 *     check_rvbar_lifecycle_anchors.py): live bit0-set + entry 0 is
 *     the STALE state; the kext-lawful transition is power_off
 *     (ANE_deInit when dev+0x3FB, then PMGR ps 0x2e0 ← 0x00000000 via
 *     the dev+0x190 PMGR accessor) → power_on → re-init, NEVER an
 *     RVBAR write while bit0 is set. RVBAR (engine accessor,
 *     0x1050000, u64) is written only after a read64 with bit0 == 0;
 *     CPU_CONTROL write32 0 then 0x10 runs on BOTH paths; success =
 *     SCRATCH7 (dev+0x454 selector) read32 == 0x08042006. Open edge:
 *     whether ps-off clears bit0 — one live read-only read64 after a
 *     domain-off answers it. IMPLEMENTATION CAVEAT: the ps-word write
 *     is the class that froze this host from kernel context
 *     (2026-09-19 receipt) and the W3 gate demands act=0xf +
 *     AUTO_ENABLE clear afterwards — the reset vehicle (userspace
 *     stage vs in-kernel) is a Main decision, so the fold+start path
 *     stays behind the itemized preflight gates.
 *   3. Ack model — TWO-PHASE, SINGLE REGISTER, TRANSITION-BASED
 *      (rvbar-lifecycle receipt 6288b0b, 57/57 anchors; supersedes the
 *      pass6 SCRATCH0-beacon reading): pre-CPU, SCRATCH cells are
 *      cleared and SCRATCH7 is PULSED 1 -> 0 (stale READY/wake
 *      cleared); after CPU_CONTROL 0 -> 0x10, poll A demands a FRESH
 *      SCRATCH7 READY 0x08042006 (fw alive; fw_alive). Publication
 *      (init suballoc DVA -> SCRATCH0/1, dsb st) happens ONLY after
 *      poll A; then wake 0xf7fbdff9 -> SCRATCH7 releases the fw; poll
 *      B awaits SCRATCH7 DONE 0x08042006 (booted) and reads back
 *      SCRATCH0/1. Because of the pulse, a post-CPU READY is
 *      unambiguous — no stale-ack hazard. The SCRATCH0 marker (fn
 *      0x86EC) is not a gate.
 *      Selene raw anchors: READY write idx7 @0x7360-0x7388 (movz
 *      0x2006 @0x7364, mov w1,#7 @0x7368, movk 0x804 @0x736c, slot
 *      byte48 @0x7380, salt 0x5bdd @0x7384, blraa @0x7388); poll loop
 *      READ32 idx7 @0x73c4-0x73e4, cmp wake 0xf7fbdff9 @0x73e8,
 *      sleep(1000) @0x73f8-0x73fc; DONE ack @0x77cc-0x77f0.
 *   4. Linux allocation map (legacy branch sizes): FWIM surface =
 *      config+0x138 byte-count = 0x500000 (Main, audit 751caa4);
 *      Linux fw_buf is ANE_FW_BUF_SIZE = 0x500000 — the semantic is
 *      honored directly, covering the image vmsize 0x36c000. 'IPC '
 *      surface = min(config+4, dev+0x3A70
 *      cap) — the numeric cap needs the h14g config blob field map
 *      (open prerequisite). Init suballoc = 0x174 from a Linux-owned
 *      pool standing in for the kext dev+0x968/dev+0x980 pool (pool
 *      total size open). RTBuddy FW_INIT sizes (64K…) are the OTHER
 *      branch — never used here.
 *   5. Init publication: the fw consumes [0x08]..[0x68] (pass5) and
 *      the Linux sources of those fields are not pinned ([0x08] =
 *      *(dev+0x988+0x18) = the 'IPC ' surface DVA — the surface
 *      itself is CLOSED (pass5c/5d), its Linux allocation size open
 *      per item 4; [0x10]/[0x18] = config-size terms with
 *      config+0x138 = image byte-count closed; [0x30] = dev+0x990
 *      load-progress word) — publication cannot fire until every
 *      fw-read field has a pinned Linux source.
 *
 * Read whitelist — every MMIO read below, individually:
 *   - RVBAR eng+0x01050000: read64 width-proven (rvbar-width
 *     width_proof); W8 and W10 live Linux reads, value 0x1 each.
 *   - CPU_STATUS eng+0x1400048: phase-1 S2 whitelist; kext poll site
 *     0x…95ecfb4 (config field dev+0x49c = 0x1400048); W10 live read
 *     0x2a.
 *   - ASC mailbox controls eng+0x1408110/0x1408114: W10 live reads
 *     (both 0x00020001; 600 polls / 30 s, zero changes, zero aborts).
 *     The FATAL mailbox-class reads were the +0x1608xxx h16g analog —
 *     a different address never touched here; the 0x1854000..0x1c04000
 *     fabric-fatal window is likewise never touched.
 *   - SCRATCH eng+0x1840048..0x1840064: phase-1 S2 whitelist
 *     (all-zero pre-attach), W5 pre-read log clean, first_resume
 *     re-reads all eight on every load.
