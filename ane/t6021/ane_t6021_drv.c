/* T6021 (H14 / J414c) ANE platform driver skeleton.
 *
 * Architecture (W1/W2/W4-fix receipts; this is NOT the H13 ane driver
 * model): the fw owns the task manager and the 8 task queues
 * (CSneTMDrvH14 — the kext never programs the H13-style host TM/TQ
 * window and first touch on it external-aborted, proven twice
 * 2026-09-18), so the host brings up the MBI transport (SCRATCH wake
 * -> fw channel table -> per-channel doorbell bits at +0x1844000; the
 * m1n1 ASC mailbox analogy at +0x1608xxx is falsified and SError-fatal)
 * and talks CSNE_CMD over RTBuddy app endpoints. Submission is gated on
 * the channel-table dump pinning the INIT doorbell bit; this skeleton
 * probes, maps, attaches power and captures the handshake.
 *
 * Probe makes no engine-window write and no SET write. First-touch
 * reads at resume are the phase-1-proven ASC status region plus the
 * kext-evidenced MBI registers (SCRATCH/message pair — the kext reads
 * and writes these at runtime on this silicon; the +0x1608xxx family
 * the kext never touches is what aborted the machine). The first
 * on-device run must ride netconsole with the named-stage dev_info
 * lines as the flush points.
